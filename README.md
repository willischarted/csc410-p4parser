# csc410-p4parser

Hi Victor, the file you are looking in for this week's submission is labelled submission_2.rkt 
In there is our implementation, and at the end, we have some test lines that ouput the sample projects inputs you specified.
You should just have to run to see the output. We have also labelled the tests to make it clear.

Note:
In declaring variables, you will notice that while in example 3, we are able to remove repeated variable declarations. However in ex 5, the value could have multiple types. In this case it is in int, but the way it is coded right now defaults it to the "if" which is of type void. Moving forward we are looking into strategies to fix this.
